Fails for small numbers because the precision is too low
e.g. 0.00000000009 sqrt will show number that stops because it only checks 0.001 as good-enough?
Large numbers... not sure..
(define (good-enough? guess x)
	(or
	 	(< (abs (- (square guess) x)) 0.01)
		(< (abs (- (guess) (improve guess x))) 0.001)
	))
Works better for large numbers, because small numbers need smaller precision (or large because large don't need smaller precision)
